# Your answer to all of SteamVR's shortcomings
I am sick of having SteamVR start up 4-5 programs when I start it. Couldnt this all be made into one unified program, which YOU the end user can configure for your needs? This is what I want to accomplish for this personal project.

## Planned requirements for this program:
- Report battery percentage of both controllers and if necessary HMD.
- Voice controlled search button to configure -> "youtube" = https://youtube.com
- User Interface to configure behaviour under SteamVR
- Support for Mixed Reality setups
